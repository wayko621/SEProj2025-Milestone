<h2>Project Name</h2>
<p>The University Smart Classroom Management System</p>

<h2>Project Focus</h2>

<p>Our project focuses on a software based management system for the classroom pertaining to Montclair University administrators and faculty members.<br /> 
This project aims to enhance the universityâ€™s ways of scheduling classrooms, accommodating resources and handling technology.<br /> 
Our goal is to provide our stakeholders the best user experience for our key stakeholders.<br />
Doing so we wish to allow administrators to review scheduling access and distribute resources as required by the faculty.<br /> 
Faculty members of the university would be given the ability to request the resources as needed, book classrooms according to their schedules and report issues as they see fit.<br /> 
Overall, our team wishes to directly allow for the feedback of our stakeholders and create an application that works to support their needs.</p>
